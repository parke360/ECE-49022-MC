# ECE-49022-MC
Microcontroller code (with updated libraries)

This is my code for my ECE 49022 project, using an ESP32 to read vital sign data from sensors and send this data to the computer through Zigbee. I created this repository because I had to edit the XBee library to use it with one of the sensor libraries, and I did not want to lose my work in the event something bad happens.
